Designed a Twitter-like social network website with the ability to make/edit/like posts, follow users, and filter posts based on followers. The app was built on the Django Framework using Python and pure Javascript.

# What I learned
* Deeper understanding and usage of Promises and asynchronous operations.
* Deeper understanding of event-listeners and CRUDS operations.
* Better knowledge in designing a relational database system using Django Models/Migration system. (No RAW SQL commands)
* Parsing JSON data between the front-end and the back-end to fetch/send data.
